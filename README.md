# Micro-Credential Aggregator Platform 🇮🇳

⚠️ Apology & Updated Project Demo Link
🙏 Apology Notice

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.
Earlier, this project’s demonstration video was uploaded to YouTube, and its QR code was embedded in the presentation (PPT).
Unfortunately, my YouTube channel was terminated, which made the original video link inaccessible.

🎥 New Upload

To ensure everyone can still access the project demonstration,
I have re-uploaded the video on Google Drive.

Your feedback and encouragement mean a lot to me as I continue developing this project. ❤️


A responsive frontend prototype for a government-compliant platform designed to centralize, verify, and showcase micro-credentials and professional certifications in India. This project aims to address the critical issue of certificate fraud by creating a trusted ecosystem for learners, employers, and government bodies.

## ## Problem Statement

India's skilling ecosystem is vast but fragmented. With over 400 million workers, verifying the authenticity of certificates is a major challenge for employers, leading to a significant fraud crisis. This lack of a centralized, trusted system hinders genuine skill recognition and creates inefficiencies in the job market. This platform proposes a unified solution to aggregate and verify credentials, aligning them with national standards like the **National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF)**.

## ## Key Features

This prototype showcases the core user-facing features of the platform:

* **🏡 Landing Page:** A welcoming introduction to the platform's mission, key statistics, and core features.
* **📋 Centralized Dashboard:** A user-centric dashboard to view statistics at a glance, including total, verified, and pending certificates, along with the user's highest achieved NSQF level.
* **📤 AI-Powered Upload:** A seamless certificate upload process with a drag-and-drop interface. The UI suggests an AI/OCR backend that would automatically parse and pre-fill certificate details.
* **🏛️ Government Integration:** The design includes clear integration points for major Indian digital initiatives like **DigiLocker**, **Skill India Digital**, and **NCVET** for direct and verified import of credentials.
* **👤 Shareable Public Portfolio:** A clean, professional portfolio page that aggregates all verified credentials. It features a shareable URL and a QR code placeholder for instant verification by potential employers.
* **📊 Skills Analytics:** The portfolio includes a visual chart summarizing the user's top skills based on their collection of certificates.

## ## Tech Stack

This is a pure frontend prototype built with fundamental web technologies.

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Modern styling with CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for a maintainable and theme-able design system.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Vanilla JavaScript for handling UI interactivity, page navigation (simulating a Single Page Application), and dynamic content rendering.
* **Chart.js:** An open-source charting library used to render the skills analytics bar chart.

## ## How to Run Locally

Since this project uses no build tools or external packages (besides the Chart.js CDN), running it is very simple:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

And that's it! The web application will be running locally.

## ## Future Scope & Potential Enhancements

This prototype lays the groundwork for a full-fledged application. Future development would include:

* **Backend Development:** Building a secure backend (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Django) with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to manage user data, certificates, and verification status.
* **User Authentication:** Implementing a robust authentication system (e.g., OAuth2) for secure user login and registration.
* **Live API Integration:** Connecting to the actual APIs for DigiLocker, NCVET, and other government platforms.
* **AI/OCR Service:** Implementing a machine learning service to accurately parse uploaded certificate images and PDFs.
* **Blockchain for Verification:** Using a distributed ledger to create immutable, tamper-proof records of verified credentials.
* **Employer Portal:** Creating a separate interface for employers to search for and verify candidate portfolios.
